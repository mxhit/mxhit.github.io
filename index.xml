      <description>One of my biggest achievements of 2023 was developing the reading tempo I had back in college &amp;ndash; it may seem trivial but it is a big deal for me. I started with a very humble goal of reading 10 books in 2023 and I was able to achieve it by November. Here&amp;rsquo;s the list of books I read.
To achieve this goal I had to:
 Remove social media apps from my phone.</description>

      <title>Primer on Font Types</title>
      <link>https://dodhia.in/blog/primer-on-font-types/</link>

      <description>The target audience for this blog are non-designer folks like me who have little to no clue about the various types of font files and when to use which. What prompted me to write this blog is replacing the font on this blog with &amp;ldquo;Space Grotesk&amp;rdquo; family. I downloaded the zip of the font which contained three folders: otf/, ttf/ and woff2/. I had no idea what was the difference between these files so I looked them up, and here&amp;rsquo;s what I found.</description>

      <title>Spotify Wrapped 2023</title>
      <link>https://dodhia.in/blog/spotify-wrapped-2023/</link>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t relate to the Spotify Wrapped discourse/rants happening online. Neither do I have Pritam as my top artist nor have I been listening to songs like Noida &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m not saying this to appear edgy.
The truth is my listening activity (music + podcasts) has steadily dropped in the last two years, main reason being I can&amp;rsquo;t focus on work while listening to something. I have barely listened to a day&amp;rsquo;s worth of music and 3 hours of podcasts this past year.</description>

      <title>Social Media Rant</title>
      <link>https://dodhia.in/blog/social-media-rant/</link>

      <description>These days opening Social Media feels like visiting a zoo, where you wander around aimlessly seeing what other animals are up to. The life of those animals don&amp;rsquo;t affect yours in the slightest yet you look at them for a few minutes and continue to the next enclosement until you run out of them, in which case you exit after spending a chunk of your time. I see little to no benefit in this pointless loitering.</description>

      <title>Good Start to 2023</title>
      <link>https://dodhia.in/blog/good-start-to-2023/</link>

      <description>The year started with an unexpected promotion, considering I was promoted just 6 months ago. This, in my eyes, makes the stint at Infosysquite successful as I have been promoted twice while being a recipient of 2 awards, all in less than 2 years.
The days that followed were filled with kite-flying and hogging Undhiyu with family. It has been a while since we had such a large family gathering, and their presence made my favourite festival even more enjoyable.</description>

      <title>Migrating to GitHub Pages</title>
      <link>https://dodhia.in/blog/migrating-to-github-pages/</link>

      <guid>https://dodhia.in/blog/migrating-to-github-pages/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR: The website logistically didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, especially with this blog being hosted on GitHub Pages and only accessible through the website.
 After a good deal of consideration, I finally pulled the plug on my website which was hosted on the domain www.mxhit.dev. This website was up and running for only a year but the decision to migrate was based on first principles of software engineering &amp;ndash; this should have been my approach from the beginning however my reasons at the time were valid.</description>

      <title>JavaScript Rant</title>

      <description>If you were to believe the Tech Twitter gyaandus, JavaScript is probably the best language out there which can be used for all your programming needs. I feel this is misleading and enforces why you should always do your due diligence instead of blindly accepting their opinions.
JavaScript, like many programming languages, was created to solve a problem. A solution for a specific problem or a set of similar problems cannot be used for all the problems you will encounter in the tech industry.</description>

      <title>Charlatans of Web3</title>

      <description>Web 3.0, commonly referred to as Web3, has become quite the catchphrase on the internet. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what Web3 is, it&amp;rsquo;s a proposed iteration of the World Wide Web based on the Blockchain technology. Tech communities across several platforms have been bandwagoning it as if it will be the ultimate form of the Internet that fuels our lives. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel this way; in fact I have a lot of concerns due to the nature of Blockchain technologies &amp;ndash; more on this later.</description>
