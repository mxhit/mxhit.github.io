      <description>In my almost three years of experience as a Java developer, I have hardly been exposed to working with front-end technologies. A little JSP here, a tad bit of CSS there, and the occasional $(&amp;quot;#div&amp;quot;).modal() while debugging to check whether my modals were showing up correctly or not. In conclusion, very elementary. However, I switched my job after two years and currently I am working with a legacy application that employs Core Java for the back-end and Angular.</description>

      <description>The easiest part about the #100DaysOfCode Challenge is taking up the challenge. The harder part is committing to it while coming up with new ideas for each day; itâ€™s both exciting and daunting. I experienced this for the first time when I publicly committed to the challenge on Twitter. It is generally advised to have a rough map of ideas ready when taking up the challenge but I took a different approach of establishing rules simply because I need to fall in line with them while developing things every day.</description>
