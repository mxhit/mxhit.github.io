[{"categories":[],"contents":"These days opening Social Media feels like visiting a zoo, where you wander around aimlessly seeing what other animals are up to. The life of those animals don\u0026rsquo;t affect yours in the slightest yet you look at them for a few minutes and continue to the next enclosement until you run out of them, in which case you exit after spending a chunk of your time. I see little to no benefit in this pointless loitering. You seldom learn anything new and most certainly won\u0026rsquo;t remember what you saw by the end of the day.\nMy complaints stem from the grim side-effects I see in daily, long-term users. The most common ones being:\n Mindless Scrolling: The best place to see this in action is when a person is waiting for someone or something (e.g. waiting in queues, standing in the elevator, etc.). Almost always you will find someone scrolling through their messages or scrolling past a few posts on Instagram/Facebook. Being Alone: This is more of an extension to the last point. It may seem trivial but the reality is people find it uncomfortable being alone without their devices. Try running errands with your phone at home and you may realise what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to say. Short Attention Span: It is a direct consequence of consuming short-form content which leads to people looking for instant dopamine hits, so entertainment mediums which require patience are often neglected because they are \u0026ldquo;boring\u0026rdquo;. I also depise the fact that Social Media orgs have incentivized producing such content as it is relatively quicker to produce, attracts a lot of views and leaves people wanting more. It ultimately becomes a positive-feedback loop where people keep coming for more and these orgs benefit from this in multiple ways (monetization, user data, increased DAU, etc.). Virtue Signaling: Oh, this one really grinds my gears. In a constant attempt to showcase themselves at their best, people take it upon themselves to suggest/dictate how things should be to their \u0026ldquo;audience\u0026rdquo;. Everyone seems to masquerade as certified experts \u0026ndash; some in several fields \u0026ndash; and feel the need to impart their bogus gyaan to others. In reality, others seldom care let alone remember the \u0026ldquo;valuable information\u0026rdquo;.   Complaints aside, I have a few questions regarding some Instagram nonsense that I just can\u0026rsquo;t wrap my head around:\n Crossposting Birthday Stories: What is even the point? Are you trying to show how many people wished you? Are you trying to share the photo your friend used in the birthday wish story? Why are you crossposting the crossposted story? Stories: What is it about Boomerangs that you like so much? Why are you writing an entire blog post in your story with barely legible font size? Are the food photos also getting uploaded on Zomato where they could be of use?

This, in my eyes, makes the stint at Infosys quite successful as I have been promoted twice while being a recipient of 2 awards, all in less than 2 years.\nThe days that followed were filled with kite-flying and hogging Undhiyu with family. It has been a while since we had such a large family gathering, and their presence made my favourite festival even more enjoyable.\nWith February came a short but eventful trip to Varkala for my uncle\u0026rsquo;s wedding. The journey was abysmal in every way possible thanks to Indian Railway\u0026rsquo;s management or lack thereof, and was equally amusing thanks to Trivandrum\u0026rsquo;s Domestic Airport \u0026ndash; it looked less like an airport and more like some commercial complex. This trip provided a much needed break from city-life, and left me yearning for a few more days in the resort.

Being a new follower of the sport, I was busy learning and remembering names, rules and concepts that were being thrown my way. As the season progressed towards the finale, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but naturally get drawn to two drivers: Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel. The fact that these two would be in the same team for 2019 made me even more excited. The 2019 season turned out to be good overall for both the drivers and Ferrari. It cemented my support for both drivers.\nThis season has been tough to follow with Charles failing to secure his maiden title, and Vettel announcing his retirement from the sport. While I am glad Charles secured second place in the Driver\u0026rsquo;s Championship, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel sad about Seb leaving the sport he loves so much. Within a span of 4 seasons, one of my favourites is leaving the sport. It will be tough watching races without him on the grid.\nI am grateful for coming across this gem of a man who always stood up for what he felt was right, and supported and cared for his colleagues irrespective of the fierce competition on track. He will always be the embodiment of humility and sportsmanship for me.\nDanke Seb! 👆 ","date":"2022-11-20","permalink":"https://dodhia.in/blog/danke-seb/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[""],"title":"Danke Seb"},{"categories":[],"contents":"TL;DR: The website logistically didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, especially with this blog being hosted on GitHub Pages and only accessible through the website.\n After a good deal of consideration, I finally pulled the plug on my website which was hosted on the domain www.mxhit.dev. This website was up and running for only a year but the decision to migrate was based on first principles of software engineering \u0026ndash; this should have been my approach from the beginning however my reasons at the time were valid.\nWhy did I develop a website? I always wanted a website of my own since I was 13 years old. Lacking the knowledge, skills and resources at the time I resorted to platforms like WordPress and Blogger to secure the bragging rights of having a website. Now, as a Software Engineer, developing a website seemed like the easiest project I could undertake, and so I did. I took this project as an opportunity to get my hands dirty with React.js , a library I always wanted to learn. I also wanted to get a feel of CI/CD.\nStructure of my website Before kickstarting development, the idea was quite simple: My website should provide basic information about what I do, what my skillsets are, and my contact information. During the development phase, I considered adding my LinkedIn testimonials \u0026ndash; because why not. It took me around 2 months to complete the development, and I released v1.0.0 almost a year ago.\nSix months later, I released v1.1.0 which contained minor aesthetic changes.\nKey takeaways from this project?  React is an intuitive library for developing web apps. It was fun to work with. I liked Tailwind \u0026rsquo;s approach of CSS although it has a long way to go in order to compete with Bootstrap. Deploying and maintaining through Netlify was a breeze. React was overkill for the scope of this project i.e., a read-only website for visitors. Adding pages or functionalities required a good amount of time to get things right. I completely overlooked blogging, something I enjoyed during my schooling years. Implementing a blog looked like an Herculean task now.  Alternatives For my use-case, static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo seemed very appealing. I decided to go with Hugo purely on the basis of good documentation and this amazing minimalistic theme . I developed and hosted this blog just a few days after the release of v1.1.0. Getting the entire blog up and running only took me a day and adding content was only a matter of few seconds, including new pages \u0026ndash; this also encourages me to write more. In the near future, I intend to add a Projects section to this blog and the ease with which I can set it up is laughable.\nFinal decision Coming around to first principles for my case, all I needed was a decent-looking website with ease of management. I could have gone the vanilla route by using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript but that would have become a pain point whenever I wanted to change a few things here and there \u0026ndash; which was the case with React. Also, having two separate websites was a bad look.\nSo, I took the decision of migrating everything here and not renewing my domain. The website still lives on at mxhit.netlify.app and will be added to the Projects section soon. I am happy I got to learn React and CI/CD through this website, and I have since made a few private projects using React and Tailwind.\n","date":"2022-10-05","permalink":"https://dodhia.in/blog/migrating-to-github-pages/","section":"","summary":"","tags":["","","",""],"title":"Migrating to GitHub Pages"},{"categories":[],"contents":"If you were to believe the Tech Twitter gyaandus, JavaScript is probably the best language out there which can be used for all your programming needs. I feel this is misleading and enforces why you should always do your due diligence instead of blindly accepting their opinions.\nJavaScript, like many programming languages, was created to solve a problem. A solution for a specific problem or a set of similar problems cannot be used for all the problems you will encounter in the tech industry. Just because you have JavaScript runtimes like Deno , Bun and Node.js does not mean it is the right thing to choose every single time. I love this popular analogy of programming languages being tools in a toolbox; a tool is always picked from the toolbox based on the scenario. Similarly, programming languages should be selected based on a thorough analysis of your requirement(s).\nI do not necessarily hate JavaScript \u0026ndash; I think it is a great language for prototyping and simple projects. However, just like other languages, JavaScript comes with certain design choices that may not be ideal for certain scenarios. Best example is the lack of types, which makes it fairly annoying for Backend development. I know TypeScript is a thing but I should not have to install an additional layer on JavaScript to get types. This is an absurd practice, in my opinion, when you already have a lot of languages that enforce strict types and have been employed for Backend developments for years.\nChoose your tools wisely.\n","date":"2022-08-16","permalink":"https://dodhia.in/blog/javascript-rant/","section":"","summary":"","tags":["",""],"title":"JavaScript Rant"},{"categories":[],"contents":"Web 3.0, commonly referred to as Web3, has become quite the catchphrase on the internet. For those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know what Web3 is, it\u0026rsquo;s a proposed iteration of the World Wide Web based on the Blockchain technology. Tech communities across several platforms have been bandwagoning it as if it will be the ultimate form of the Internet that fuels our lives. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel this way; in fact I have a lot of concerns due to the nature of Blockchain technologies \u0026ndash; more on this later.\nMy main gripe with Web3 is the way it\u0026rsquo;s marketed: Web2 companies are hives of scum and villainy. To make this worse, proponents of Web3 throw these zero-sum statements at you which is bound to grind your gears\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t blindly support Web3 you don\u0026rsquo;t get the future\n  Since you are so priviliged in the Web2 world, you clearly lack the vision to see what the future holds\n From my personal experience, there is almost no room for healthy discussions with these people. Not only do they propagate this antagonistic nonsense, they claim Decentralization and Immutability offered by Blockchain technologies will be the saving grace on the Internet.\nMy concerns for a Web3 world  In the setting of a decentralized social media app, my posts/content will be accessible by people on the blockchain. Since blockchains by nature are immutable, I cannot change what I have posted.  If I post anything by accident, it will be shared with the whole network. What if someone posts revenge or child pornography? What recourse is left since there is no moderating authority/administration that can take action on such posts? If there is indeed a body responsible for moderation then does it not violate the fundamental principles behind decentralization?   Looking at the current systems in place for Web3 offerings like Cryptocurrencies and NFTs, there is usually an organisation that does the heavy-lifting for its users (e.g. account setup, wallet configuration, etc.).  If we are to move away from these organisations, it leaves users to fend for themselves when it concerns those heavy-lifting tasks. Users will be expected to know the ins and outs of the technologies involved which leaves everyone with a steep learning curve \u0026ndash; which is in contrast to the user-friendly approach used during system design of most platforms.   Focussing on Immutability and Decentralization, there could be grave consequences for victims of frauds and scams: No central body to approach with an irreversible transaction.  Speaking of irreversible transactions, exchanges have been observed reversing transactions or not allowing transactions on the pretense of technical difficulties (cough cough\u0026hellip; WazirX\u0026hellip; cough cough). Popular NFT marketplace, OpenSea, is known to delist stolen NFTs, again indicating how the big players in the current Web3 world only claim to want the \u0026ldquo;benefits\u0026rdquo; of blockchain while maintaining control like Web2 companies.    These concerns aside, innumerable scams, frauds and ponzi schemes have come to light in the last few years, giving a bad reputation to Web3 which is supposedly in its nascent stage.\nWeb3 appears to be in shambles right now and I reckon it still has a fair bit of evolving to undergo if people are to welcome this new version of the Internet.\n","date":"2022-05-29","permalink":"https://dodhia.in/blog/charlatans-of-web3/","section":"","summary":"","tags":["",""],"title":"Charlatans of Web3"},{"categories":[],"contents":"In my almost three years of experience as a Java developer, I have hardly been exposed to working with front-end technologies. A little JSP here, a tad bit of CSS there, and the occasional $(\u0026quot;#div\u0026quot;).modal() while debugging to check whether my modals were showing up correctly or not. In conclusion, very elementary. However, I switched my job after two years and currently I am working with a legacy application that employs Core Java for the back-end and Angular.js for the front-end. This new project has given me a wonderful opportunity to learn JavaScript and I have truly begun to appreciate its beauty.\nLearning JavaScript was not much of a hassle when compared to Java. I came across some wonderful resources that gave me a deep understanding of how the language works. One such resource was freeCodeCamp’s JavaScript curriculum . You will find some of my favourite features from ES6 listed below.\nConstant Coming from Java, this feels like a familiar hug. Constants are immutable variables which cannot be reassigned new value(s). This means you can freely manipulate content of the constant variable but cannot redefine it with some new value.\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3]; arr[1] += 5; // manipulating the value console.log(arr); // prints [1, 7, 3] arr = [2, 5, 7]; // throws Uncaught TypeError: invalid assignment to const ‘arr’ Block-scoped Variables (a.k.a. let variables) Another feature which will make a Java developer feel right at home. These variables, defined with the keyword let, have the scope of the block they are defined in.\nlet i = 1;  {  let i = 10;  console.log(i); // prints 10 }  console.log(i); // prints 1 Arrow Functions One of the most prominent and well-accepted changes is the ability to create anonymous functions using the arrow notation. This change is single-handedly responsible for clearing the clutter that anonymous functions used to create.\n// Without Arrow function var isEven = function(num) {  return num % 2 === 0; }  // With Arrow function const isEven = (num) =\u0026gt; num % 2 === 0; Look at that! Clean and concise.\nSpread Operator Contrary to the Rest Parameter, this operator allows us to spread the elements of an iterable collection, like an array or string.\nlet str = “spread”; let chars = [ …str ]; // [ “s”, “p”, “r”, “e”, “a”, “d” ]; Template Literals Template Literals, a. k. a. Template Strings, allows you to directly use a literal in an expression. The best example of a use-case is when you want to log something in the console.\nrequire(‘dotenv’).config();  const express = require(‘express’); const app = express(); const port = process.env.PORT;  app.listen(port, () =\u0026gt; console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`)); No more appending literals using the + operator.\nProperty Shorthand Like Arrow Functions, this new change allows us to define objects more easily in a simple and concise fashion.\n// Before let x = 0, y = 0; obj = { x: x, y: y };  // After let x = 0, y = 0; obj = { x, y };  There are considerably more new features in ES6 like Promises, Export, Classes, etc., which are of great significance while writing JavaScript code today. However, these topics require a lot more context and information, which does not fall into the scope of this blog — which is supposed to be a brief list of things that I liked the most.\n","date":"2022-03-28","permalink":"https://dodhia.in/blog/exploring-ecmascript6/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[""],"title":"Exploring ECMAScript6"},{"categories":[],"contents":"The easiest part about the #100DaysOfCode Challenge is taking up the challenge. The harder part is committing to it while coming up with new ideas for each day; it’s both exciting and daunting. I experienced this for the first time when I publicly committed to the challenge on Twitter. It is generally advised to have a rough map of ideas ready when taking up the challenge but I took a different approach of establishing rules simply because I need to fall in line with them while developing things every day. My rationale at the time was:\n Define concrete rules and stick to them while thinking of ideas that fall within the rules.\n  Day 1: Designing the book cover of “Do The Work” by Steven Pressfield So when it came to deciding the task for Day 1, I found myself extremely unprepared. After spending a better part of an hour brainstorming, I thought of a book that I had re-read a couple of days ago. The book was Steven Pressfield’s Do The Work, and it has been of immense value to me. Just before taking up this challenge I had developed my portfolio website using React, and it would not have been possible without the help of this book. You see, I had been trying to develop this website for the last two years — using vanilla HTML and CSS, JSP, and Angular.js — but I would drop it as soon as I came across some form of a problem — ‘Resistance’ is the term the author uses in this book. The concepts the author covers in this book really helped me understand the forces at play when it comes to doing any type of work. So, when I found myself struggling to come up with an idea, I thought of designing the book cover using CSS. I was and still am terrified of doing CSS art but a fellow friend on Twitter managed to convince me to do it.\nNow that I had an idea ready, it was time to put it into action. The HTML part was very straightforward and I was done within a few minutes. The CSS part, however, still intimidated me. I was able to manage the styling of text elements without breaking any sweat but the thought of designing the pencil using CSS kept me terrified until I actually started working on it.\nCrafting the pencil Despite being terrified, I stuck to the basic fundamentals of problem solving and divided the problem at hand into smaller problems. The basic skeletal idea I had looked like this.\n\u0026lt;div id=”pencil”\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”eraser”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”holder”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”wood”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”tip”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; I immediately started working on each component of the pencil starting from the eraser as it was the easiest component and I knew I would be needing some confidence when moving to the other components. Everything went well with the Eraser and I completed the Holder and the Wood components relatively quickly.\nWhat I did not account for in the skeleton of the pencil was the triangular design you get after sharpening a pencil. This meant I had to refactor the HTML code to accommodate it and then design it as well. I had to look up “how to make a triangle using CSS” to get this done. This also helped me with finishing the tip of the pencil and adding the black nib at the end.\nThe final pencil code looked like this.\n\u0026lt;div id=”pencil”\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”eraser”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”holder”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”wood”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”design”\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”sharpener”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”sharpener”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”tip”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div id=”nib”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Here is my Codepen for the book cover. Takeaways I spent more than two and a half hours on this and I learnt about a lot of concepts I need to focus on:\n Master basic shapes using CSS before making moving to complex shapes. I need to practice positioning and aligning elements.  Approach going forward I have realised I have little to no knowledge about CSS that is required for diving into CSS Art, and I need to practice CSS as much as I can before diving into complex CSS art.\n Day 2: F1 gantry lights I decided on the F1 gantry lights primarily based on the takeaways from Day 1; secondary reason is my love for Formula One but we can ignore that. Now, I had to keep it simple and ensure I work on basic shapes. For those of you who do not know what gantry lights are, they are basically used to indicate the start of a race — they have some other purposes as well but it is irrelevant at the moment.\nA couple of rectangles with a few circles in them , yeah. You can see why this seemed like a good choice for creating basic shapes with CSS. The skeletal structure also seemed to very simple for this one.\n\u0026lt;div class=”f1-lights”\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-— one vertical light column --\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div class=”stand”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!— horizontal bar connecting all vertical columns --\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div class=”light-strip”\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!— vertical strip containing lights --\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div class=”light”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div class=”light”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div class=”light”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;div class=”light on”\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Rest of the process was fairly simple, and I was done with it in an hour before the start of the Russian Grand Prix. This was fun and I feel very confident for tomorrow.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Codepen. Takeaways  Basic shapes are not very complicated and I will probably work on them on the side instead of reserving an entire day of the challenge for them. This would have seemed a lot cooler if I knew how animations work in CSS. Time to get on it. Need to learn how to blend colours in CSS.   I quit the challenge a few days after Day 2 as I was unable to dedicate time to the challenge. Simply put, the challenge ranked way lower in my list of priorities to be worth spending time on. I could definitely see the merits of undertaking this challenge as it forces you to choose a specific topic to learn and acts as a catalyst in the learning journey.\nI would recommend this challenge to anyone who can spare a good amount of time on a daily basis for this challenge.\n","date":"2021-11-17","permalink":"https://dodhia.in/blog/brief-stint-with-100doc/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Brief Stint with the #100DaysOfCode Challenge"}]
