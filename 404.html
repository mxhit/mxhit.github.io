        "content": "The target audience for this blog are non-designer folks like me who have little to no clue about the various types of font files and when to use which. What prompted me to write this blog is replacing the font on this blog with \u0026ldquo;Space Grotesk\u0026rdquo; family. I downloaded the zip of the font which contained three folders: otf/, ttf/ and woff2/. I had no idea what was the difference between these files so I looked them up, and here\u0026rsquo;s what I found.\nTrueType Font (TTF)  Font format developed by Apple in the 1980s, which was licensed to Microsoft. Requires only one file for screens and a separate PostScript file for printing.  PostScript fonts were created by Adobe. The font file has two parts: Printing information and Display for Screen information. Pro: Can provide high-quality printing. Con: Different versions for Mac and Windows which led to reliability issues across both systems.    OpenType Font (OTF)  Jointly created by Adobe and Microsoft. Based on TTF with support for expanded character sets like ligatures, glyphs, etc.  Web Open Format Font (WOFF)  WOFF1 was developed by Mozilla, Opera and Microsoft. This is a web-exclusive and compressed version of the above-mentioned formats. Unlike TTF and OTF, this font cannot be installed on a system. Best suited for web as compressed files means faster loadtimes on a website. WOFF2 was developed by Google with improved compression.  Use Cases  Documentation: TTF can be used as expanded character sets are usually not required \u0026ndash; if required, go for OTF. Designing: OTF should be preferred as the extra character data may be useful. SVG fonts (new version of OTF) can also be used. Printing: Definitely OTF. Web Development: WOFF2 because built for the web with better performance.  ",

Neither do I have Pritam as my top artist nor have I been listening to songs like Noida \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m not saying this to appear edgy.\nThe truth is my listening activity (music + podcasts) has steadily dropped in the last two years, main reason being I can\u0026rsquo;t focus on work while listening to something. I have barely listened to a day\u0026rsquo;s worth of music and 3 hours of podcasts this past year. I\u0026rsquo;m not concerned with not listening at work \u0026ndash; in fact I prefer it that way \u0026ndash; but I\u0026rsquo;m definitely concerned with not listening outside of work. If I consider the last three Spotify Wrapped my listening activity was really high in 2021, it drastically dropped in 2022, and is now on the rise again.\nThis sudden fluctuation in listening activity is really odd and something to introspect about. Hopefully I will rediscover the joy of listening to music and the 2024 Wrapped will be an improvement.\n",

        "content": "These days opening Social Media feels like visiting a zoo, where you wander around aimlessly seeing what other animals are up to. The life of those animals don\u0026rsquo;t affect yours in the slightest yet you look at them for a few minutes and continue to the next enclosement until you run out of them, in which case you exit after spending a chunk of your time. I see little to no benefit in this pointless loitering. You seldom learn anything new and most certainly won\u0026rsquo;t remember what you saw by the end of the day.\nMy complaints stem from the grim side-effects I see in daily, long-term users. The most common ones being:\n Mindless Scrolling: The best place to see this in action is when a person is waiting for someone or something (e.g. waiting in queues, standing in the elevator, etc.). Almost always you will find someone scrolling through their messages or scrolling past a few posts on Instagram/Facebook. Being Alone: This is more of an extension to the last point. It may seem trivial but the reality is people find it uncomfortable being alone without their devices. Try running errands with your phone at home and you may realise what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to say. Short Attention Span: It is a direct consequence of consuming short-form content which leads to people looking for instant dopamine hits, so entertainment mediums which require patience are often neglected because they are \u0026ldquo;boring\u0026rdquo;. I also depise the fact that Social Media orgs have incentivized producing such content as it is relatively quicker to produce, attracts a lot of views and leaves people wanting more. It ultimately becomes a positive-feedback loop where people keep coming for more and these orgs benefit from this in multiple ways (monetization, user data, increased DAU, etc.). Virtue Signaling: Oh, this one really grinds my gears. In a constant attempt to showcase themselves at their best, people take it upon themselves to suggest/dictate how things should be to their \u0026ldquo;audience\u0026rdquo;. Everyone seems to masquerade as certified experts \u0026ndash; some in several fields \u0026ndash; and feel the need to impart their bogus gyaan to others. In reality, others seldom care let alone remember the \u0026ldquo;valuable information\u0026rdquo;.   Complaints aside, I have a few questions regarding some Instagram nonsense that I just can\u0026rsquo;t wrap my head around:\n Crossposting Birthday Stories: What is even the point? Are you trying to show how many people wished you? Are you trying to share the photo your friend used in the birthday wish story? Why are you crossposting the crossposted story? Stories: What is it about Boomerangs that you like so much? Why are you writing an entire blog post in your story with barely legible font size? Are the food photos also getting uploaded on Zomato where they could be of use?  ",

This, in my eyes, makes the stint at Infosys quite successful as I have been promoted twice while being a recipient of 2 awards, all in less than 2 years.\nThe days that followed were filled with kite-flying and hogging Undhiyu with family. It has been a while since we had such a large family gathering, and their presence made my favourite festival even more enjoyable.\nWith February came a short but eventful trip to Varkala for my uncle\u0026rsquo;s wedding. The journey was abysmal in every way possible thanks to Indian Railway\u0026rsquo;s management or lack thereof, and was equally amusing thanks to Trivandrum\u0026rsquo;s Domestic Airport \u0026ndash; it looked less like an airport and more like some commercial complex. This trip provided a much needed break from city-life, and left me yearning for a few more days in the resort. Hopefully, I will be able to revist the place soon.\n",

Being a new follower of the sport, I was busy learning and remembering names, rules and concepts that were being thrown my way. As the season progressed towards the finale, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but naturally get drawn to two drivers: Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel. The fact that these two would be in the same team for 2019 made me even more excited. The 2019 season turned out to be good overall for both the drivers and Ferrari. It cemented my support for both drivers.\nThis season has been tough to follow with Charles failing to secure his maiden title, and Vettel announcing his retirement from the sport. While I am glad Charles secured second place in the Driver\u0026rsquo;s Championship, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel sad about Seb leaving the sport he loves so much. Within a span of 4 seasons, one of my favourites is leaving the sport. It will be tough watching races without him on the grid.\nI am grateful for coming across this gem of a man who always stood up for what he felt was right, and supported and cared for his colleagues irrespective of the fierce competition on track. He will always be the embodiment of humility and sportsmanship for me.\nDanke Seb! 👆 ",

        "content": "TL;DR: The website logistically didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, especially with this blog being hosted on GitHub Pages and only accessible through the website.\n After a good deal of consideration, I finally pulled the plug on my website which was hosted on the domain www.mxhit.dev. This website was up and running for only a year but the decision to migrate was based on first principles of software engineering \u0026ndash; this should have been my approach from the beginning however my reasons at the time were valid.\nWhy did I develop a website? I always wanted a website of my own since I was 13 years old. Lacking the knowledge, skills and resources at the time I resorted to platforms like WordPress and Blogger to secure the bragging rights of having a website. Now, as a Software Engineer, developing a website seemed like the easiest project I could undertake, and so I did. I took this project as an opportunity to get my hands dirty with React.js , a library I always wanted to learn. I also wanted to get a feel of CI/CD.\nStructure of my website Before kickstarting development, the idea was quite simple: My website should provide basic information about what I do, what my skillsets are, and my contact information. During the development phase, I considered adding my LinkedIn testimonials \u0026ndash; because why not. It took me around 2 months to complete the development, and I released v1.0.0 almost a year ago.\nSix months later, I released v1.1.0 which contained minor aesthetic changes.\nKey takeaways from this project?  React is an intuitive library for developing web apps. It was fun to work with. I liked Tailwind \u0026rsquo;s approach of CSS although it has a long way to go in order to compete with Bootstrap. Deploying and maintaining through Netlify was a breeze. React was overkill for the scope of this project i.e., a read-only website for visitors. Adding pages or functionalities required a good amount of time to get things right. I completely overlooked blogging, something I enjoyed during my schooling years. Implementing a blog looked like an Herculean task now.  Alternatives For my use-case, static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo seemed very appealing. I decided to go with Hugo purely on the basis of good documentation and this amazing minimalistic theme . I developed and hosted this blog just a few days after the release of v1.1.0. Getting the entire blog up and running only took me a day and adding content was only a matter of few seconds, including new pages \u0026ndash; this also encourages me to write more. In the near future, I intend to add a Projects section to this blog and the ease with which I can set it up is laughable.\nFinal decision Coming around to first principles for my case, all I needed was a decent-looking website with ease of management. I could have gone the vanilla route by using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript but that would have become a pain point whenever I wanted to change a few things here and there \u0026ndash; which was the case with React. Also, having two separate websites was a bad look.\nSo, I took the decision of migrating everything here and not renewing my domain. The website still lives on at mxhit.netlify.app and will be added to the Projects section soon. I am happy I got to learn React and CI/CD through this website, and I have since made a few private projects using React and Tailwind.\n",

        "content": "If you were to believe the Tech Twitter gyaandus, JavaScript is probably the best language out there which can be used for all your programming needs. I feel this is misleading and enforces why you should always do your due diligence instead of blindly accepting their opinions.\nJavaScript, like many programming languages, was created to solve a problem. A solution for a specific problem or a set of similar problems cannot be used for all the problems you will encounter in the tech industry. Just because you have JavaScript runtimes like Deno , Bun and Node.js does not mean it is the right thing to choose every single time. I love this popular analogy of programming languages being tools in a toolbox; a tool is always picked from the toolbox based on the scenario. Similarly, programming languages should be selected based on a thorough analysis of your requirement(s).\nI do not necessarily hate JavaScript \u0026ndash; I think it is a great language for prototyping and simple projects. However, just like other languages, JavaScript comes with certain design choices that may not be ideal for certain scenarios. Best example is the lack of types, which makes it fairly annoying for Backend development. I know TypeScript is a thing but I should not have to install an additional layer on JavaScript to get types. This is an absurd practice, in my opinion, when you already have a lot of languages that enforce strict types and have been employed for Backend developments for years.\nChoose your tools wisely.\n",

Not only do they propagate this antagonistic nonsense, they claim Decentralization and Immutability offered by Blockchain technologies will be the saving grace on the Internet.\nMy concerns for a Web3 world  In the setting of a decentralized social media app, my posts/content will be accessible by people on the blockchain. Since blockchains by nature are immutable, I cannot change what I have posted.  If I post anything by accident, it will be shared with the whole network. What if someone posts revenge or child pornography? What recourse is left since there is no moderating authority/administration that can take action on such posts? If there is indeed a body responsible for moderation then does it not violate the fundamental principles behind decentralization?   Looking at the current systems in place for Web3 offerings like Cryptocurrencies and NFTs, there is usually an organisation that does the heavy-lifting for its users (e.g. account setup, wallet configuration, etc.).  If we are to move away from these organisations, it leaves users to fend for themselves when it concerns those heavy-lifting tasks. Users will be expected to know the ins and outs of the technologies involved which leaves everyone with a steep learning curve \u0026ndash; which is in contrast to the user-friendly approach used during system design of most platforms.   Focussing on Immutability and Decentralization, there could be grave consequences for victims of frauds and scams: No central body to approach with an irreversible transaction.  Speaking of irreversible transactions, exchanges have been observed reversing transactions or not allowing transactions on the pretense of technical difficulties (cough cough\u0026hellip; WazirX\u0026hellip; cough cough). Popular NFT marketplace, OpenSea, is known to delist stolen NFTs, again indicating how the big players in the current Web3 world only claim to want the \u0026ldquo;benefits\u0026rdquo; of blockchain while maintaining control like Web2 companies.    These concerns aside, innumerable scams, frauds and ponzi schemes have come to light in the last few years, giving a bad reputation to Web3 which is supposedly in its nascent stage.\nWeb3 appears to be in shambles right now and I reckon it still has a fair bit of evolving to undergo if people are to welcome this new version of the Internet.\n",
