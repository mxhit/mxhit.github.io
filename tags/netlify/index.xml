      <description>TL;DR: The website logistically didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, especially with this blog being hosted on GitHub Pages and only accessible through the website.
 After a good deal of consideration, I finally pulled the plug on my website which was hosted on the domain www.mxhit.dev. This website was up and running for only a year but the decision to migrate was based on first principles of software engineering &amp;ndash; this should have been my approach from the beginning however my reasons at the time were valid.</description>
