This website was up and running for only a year but the decision to migrate was based on first principles of software engineering – this should have been my approach from the beginning however my reasons at the time were valid.\nWhy did I develop a website? I always wanted a website of my own since I was 13 years old. Lacking the knowledge, skills and resources at the time I resorted to platforms like WordPress and Blogger to secure the bragging rights of having a website. Now, as a Software Engineer, developing a website seemed like the easiest project I could undertake, and so I did. I took this project as an opportunity to get my hands dirty with React.js, a library I always wanted to learn. I also wanted to get a feel of CI/CD.\nStructure of my website Before kickstarting development, the idea was quite simple: My website should provide basic information about what I do, what my skillsets are, and my contact information. During the development phase, I considered adding my LinkedIn testimonials – because why not. It took me around 2 months to complete the development, and I released v1.0.0 almost a year ago.\nSix months later, I released v1.1.0 which contained minor aesthetic changes.\nKey takeaways from this project?  React is an intuitive library for developing web apps. It was fun to work with. I liked Tailwind’s approach of CSS although it has a long way to go in order to compete with Bootstrap. Deploying and maintaining through Netlify was a breeze. React was overkill for the scope of this project i.e., a read-only website for visitors. Adding pages or functionalities required a good amount of time to get things right. I completely overlooked blogging, something I enjoyed during my schooling years. Implementing a blog looked like an Herculean task now.  Alternatives For my use-case, static-site generators like Jekyll and Hugo seemed very appealing. I decided to go with Hugo purely on the basis of good documentation and this amazing minimalistic theme. I developed and hosted this blog just a few days after the release of v1.1.0. Getting the entire blog up and running only took me a day and adding content was only a matter of few seconds, including new pages – this also encourages me to write more. In the near future, I intend to add a Projects section to this blog and the ease with which I can set it up is laughable.\nFinal decision Coming around to first principles for my case, all I needed was a decent-looking website with ease of management. I could have gone the vanilla route by using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript but that would have become a pain point whenever I wanted to change a few things here and there – which was the case with React. Also, having two separate websites was a bad look.\nSo, I took the decision of migrating everything here and not renewing my domain. The website still lives on at mxhit.netlify.app and will be added to the Projects section soon. I am happy I got to learn React and CI/CD through this website, and I have since made a few private projects using React and Tailwind.\n","wordCount":"581","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-10-05T12:11:28+05:30","dateModified":"2022-10-05T12:11:28+05:30","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://dodhia.in/blog/migrating-to-github-pages/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mohit Dodhia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://dodhia.in/favicon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://dodhia.in/ accesskey=h title="Mohit Dodhia (Alt + H)">Mohit Dodhia</a>
